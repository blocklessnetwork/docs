# Network Contributors

The Blockless Network Contributors are the supplier of the hardware resources that service the network.

Due to WASMâ€™s native multi-platform support, the Blockless network can host various types of hardware from traditional server clusters to Raspberry Pis or even customized IoT devices. The advantage of this multi-platform Worker layer is two-fold. First, with a much-lowered entry barrier, the Blockless network can reach a significantly larger geographic coverage, providing better edge functionalities compared with traditional edge solutions. Second, with more diverse hardware resources, through Extensions, you will be able to interface directly with a variety of different host resources and data. Data feed from the host temperature sensor is a good example.
