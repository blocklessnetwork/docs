# Orchestrators

Orchestrators distribute the deployed Function Bundle and send the payload information to the designated worker(s) according to the orchestration algorithm. The Orchestrators form a global consensus and therefore assemble a customized Cosmos-based blockchain. This Orchestration Chain has a block time of 6 seconds.

Currently, the orchestration algorithm utilizes the ELO rating system to calculate the optimal worker subnetwork or shard for a specific function in accordance with its manifest specifications. The algorithm is currently being worked on to adapt to more customized parameters such as geographic locations.
