# Introduction to Blockless

Blockless is a decentralized web service platform that is designed to serve as an execution layer within the modular Web3 ecosystem. Whether you're building blockchain oracles, Web3 indexers, NFT platforms, or any dApps that cannot be built on a blockchain alone, Blockless has the services to help you build decentralized applications with flexibility, scalability, and reliability.

## Quickstart

The fastest way to get started with Blockless is to deploy a [function](/docs/functions). Follow this [quick start guide](/docs/functions/quickstart) to have your function running in under 5 minutes. You can either deploy it using the web console or the [CLI](/docs/cli). 

If you want to learn more about the network architecture, decentralization premise, composability, or other topics, you can find them in the Concept section.
