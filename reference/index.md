Learn how to use Extensions to supercharge your Blockless Functions.

## Extensions

Extensions are plug-in-like software installed on a worker that provide extra functionalities and resources the developer can directly interface within his or her functions. 

Additionally, Extensions can also serve as interfaces to hardware resources. For example, an Extension can be designed to interface with the temperature sensors on the Worker’s physical machine and provide on-demand weather data for the developer’s function.

To maintain system security, Extensions are developed by community-vetted developers and can be published to the Blockless Marketplace similar to Functions. Extensions can be requested in the function manifest for usage.
