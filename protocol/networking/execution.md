# Execution Process Overview

An execution process in which nodes in a P2P network participate in a roll call procedure to form clusters for executing tasks. The roll call is designed to request nodes with specific attributes that meet self-audit requirements for standing. The number of nodes in the cluster depends on various execution factors, such as the number of nodes, failover and resiliency types, and consensus factors. We will also explore how nodes validate, retrieve, and cache assemblies before reporting to the roll call and the subsequent selection and distribution mechanisms.

The roll call-based execution process can be divided into the following steps:

1. A roll call message is broadcasted in the network, requesting nodes with specific attributes that meet self-audit requirements for standing.
2. Nodes that match the execution parameters and have the assembly cached will report their availability for the roll call.
3. Nodes that match the execution parameters but do not have the assembly cached will first retrieve the assembly and cache it before reporting to the roll call.
4. If a node reports to the roll call before the specified timeout, it will be entered into the selection and distribution mechanisms.
5. Once selected, the nodes form a cluster and follow the requested consensus topology to execute the task and return their results.
