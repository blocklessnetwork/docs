# Orchestration Network Economics

The orchestration network is a Cosmos-based layer-1 network where the validators are responsible for performing the Execution Node Ranking, Execution Node Selection, and Task Distribution algorithms. 

As Orchestration Nodes dictate the selection of Execution Nodes and the distribution of tasks for the Execution Network, their economic incentive has to be decoupled from that of the Execution Network to avoid collusion and ensure optimal performance.

Orchestration Nodes have a higher staking requirement compared to the Execution Nodes. Typically, the number of Orchestration Nodes in the Blockless Network is also lower than that of Execution Nodes. 

As Orchestration Nodes achieve consensus on the ranking and selection of Execution Nodes as well as the distribution of tasks, honest nodes receive rewards and dishonest ones will be slashed.
