# Blockless Account Overview

The Blockless account system is designed to provide a secure and user-friendly method for managing funds and performing transactions within the network. Blockless uses an on-chain custodial account model, where users deposit funds into a smart contract, and the smart contract handles payments for the users' calls or invocations.

To set up a Blockless account, users generate an authorized on-chain custodial account associated with their Web3 address. This Web3 address serves as a unique identifier for the account and is used for various purposes, including service payment, request authorization, and account access.

Upon depositing funds into the smart contract, users can leverage the Blockless network to execute serverless applications and perform other actions, with the associated fees being automatically deducted from their account balance. By utilizing a smart contract for managing funds, the Blockless account system ensures transparency, security, and ease of use.

In summary, the Blockless account system:

1. Associates each account with a unique Web3 address, which represents distinct Blockless accounts and can be accessed separately.
2. Requires users to deposit funds into a smart contract, which acts as an on-chain custodial account for managing funds and handling payments.
3. Automates the payment process for users' calls and invocations, with fees being deducted directly from their account balance managed by the smart contract.

Note for Public Beta: Blockless currently support all EVM and Cosmos blockchain addresses, and you can connect to Blockless with MetaMask, Keplr Wallet, and Martian Wallet. The payment system is currently disabled.
