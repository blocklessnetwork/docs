# Overview

The Blockless Network is a community-owned serverless computing network. It leverages WASM+WASI to enable everyone to contribute to the network with personal computers. 

The goal for the Blockless Network is to become a global edge network that brings low-latency and high-availability computing to developers so they can better serve local customers. 

The Blockless Network allows for optional computation verifiability via state-machine replication and zero-knowledge proofs.
