# Account and Billing

## How do I access my account?

You can access your account using a supported Web3 wallet and address. Currently, your address is only used for credentials and not used for billing. We support Metamask, Keplr Wallet (Cosmos), and Martian Wallet (Aptos).

## How do I pay for my functionsâ€™ service fee?

Currently, billing is disabled for the Private Alpha release. All function deployment is free with a 15min max execution time per invocation.

## Where does the service fee go?

Portions of the service fee will go to the Blockless treasury for network maintenance and development. The majority of the service fee will be given to the worker who provided the execution service.

## What is the business model?

Here's an overview of the business model:

Revenue = network usage fees paid by developer users

90% of Revenue is to be distributed to node operators
10% of Revenue is to be used to conduct token-burn

Other forms of revenue incl. marketplace transaction fees - we allow users to share and publish their serverless functions with other users, and to token-gate or charge by usage. The platform will take a cut of a portion of their revenue.

As a crypto-native project, our focus is to grow token demand to increase FDV. For web2 users and sponsors, we may accept fiat payment which will be part of the revenue reflected in the equity stakeholders' dividend payments.
