## What is Blockless in one sentence?
A WASM-based decentralized serverless function platform

## Why do you need Blockless?

To build the next-generation decentralized applications, you need more than just a distributed blockchain ledger. Oftentimes, your application requires high-performance computation, data IO from/to IPFS, various blockchains, managed databases, and integration with various Web2 and Web3 services.

Blockless helps with your decentralized application development process in 3 major ways. 

1. With Blockless Functions and Blockless App Engine (coming Q1 2023), you can offload the heavy computation from a blockchain or centralized cloud service platform to the Blockless decentralized node network.
2. You can access your familiar Web2 and Web3 services through Blockless SDK. Currently, Blockless supports IPFS, AWS S3, Ethereum, BNB Chain (Q4 2022), and Cosmos (Q4 2022). The platform will add more service support every month down the road.
3. With Blockless Marketplace, you can use and integrate community functions and extensions into your own application architecture in a plug-and-play fashion. You can also sell and distribute your function to the community for profit.

## What is Blockless’s value proposition?

Blockless is solving the L1 blockchain scalability and fragmentation problem. These are the two fundamental roadblocks prohibiting Web3 from gaining mainstream adoption.

Blockless offers a customizable execution layer for building decentralized serverless applications. 

By offloading executions from L1 to the performant, customizable execution layer provided by Blockless, dApps are not constrained by on-chain capacity and throughput.

## How innovative is Blockless’s solution?

We are the first provider of serverless development experience for Web3. When building complex business logic that cannot be run on a blockchain alone, with Blockless dApp developers no longer have to worry about the recruitment and management of a decentralized node network. 

Developers on Blockless will only have to provide the serverless functions he/she wishes to deploy, along with a manifest file that customizes the minimum number of nodes needed, hardware requirements, geolocation, and node topology. 

We are the first to offer a product-ready x86 machine emulation within a WASM runtime. This allows devs to run ANY 32-bit software on our decentralized execution layer.

We are introducing decentralized & dynamic web hosting to Web3. This allows for censorship-resistant web pages. Here is a demo: https://youtu.be/aITDeEtkl5I

Thanks to recent development in WASI, our node software can be installed onto anything that runs a browser, such as android phones, laptops, or dedicated servers.

## Who are Blockless network's users?

Blockless is a decentralized web service platform serving two groups of users, one being our network contributors who contribute their idle computing resources in exchange for token and service fee incentives, and the other being the developers who seek distributed, decentralized, and affordable web services.

## What makes Blockless different?

Blockless is designed with security and UX/DX (user experience/developer experience) first principle. 

Under the hood, the Blockless execution engine is a WASM/WASI-based secure runtime (sandbox) that allows for fine-grained control over various system hardware and file system. It also enables the Blockless network to be truly multi-platform (as small as an IoT device to a full-fledged server cluster) and expandable through community-driven extensions. 

In addition, the system incorporates a Cosmos-based orchestration chain that handles work orchestration and load balancing. This way, all functions and applications are dispatched automatically without the developer and network contributor needing to be interfaced with each other.

For developers and network contributors, the Blockless network can be accessed via both command line interface and graphical user interface, providing the best-in-class system interaction flow. The Node software can be automatically installed onto the host machine, without the user ever needing to decipher the CLI commands.

## Is Blockless cheaper than a centralized web service?

Yes. Currently, Blockless’ service fee will be competitive with the centralized counterparts. As the network recruits more idle resources, the price will gradually go down even more as these resources have previously been neglected. 

## Will there be a token?

Yes. BLS is the official token of the Blockless network. It will be used for all in-network transactions.

## Wen token?

The BLS token is already minted for internal testing. We will launch the token officially later this year during the Public Beta launch.
